## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce the importance of **semantic HTML** and **keyboard accessibility** for a better user experience. By using proper HTML elements such as `<main>`, `<header>`, and `<nav>`, I improved the structure and accessibility of the profile card.

Additionally, I learned more about creating **focus styles** for interactive elements to ensure that keyboard users can easily navigate the links. Hereâ€™s a code snippet that demonstrates how I handled focus states:

```css
.avatar-profiles a:hover,
.avatar-profiles a:focus {
  background-color: var(--green);
  color: var(--grey-800);
}
```

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to:

- Continue practicing accessible design by improving ARIA usage and keyboard navigation.
- Explore more advanced CSS techniques for animations and transitions to enhance interactivity.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Accessible HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) - This provided a good reference for choosing semantic elements.
- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - This was useful for writing better documentation and learning about Markdown formatting.
